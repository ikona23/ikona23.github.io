  <h3><cite>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it? </cite></h3>
  <p>I have tried to have a mindfulness conversation a couple of times, but I found myself getting distracted, becoming influenced by my emotions, or my judgement is very much affected by the other person's attitude.  I can see that self confidence, stemming from the non-egoistic inner self is the way to go. Most of the time and I am harsh on myself and that is holding me back.</p>

  <h3><cite>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</cite></h3>

  <p>I love walking meditation, especially while listening to good music like this

  I still have trouble reminding myself that we are so priviledged that we can realise our self every second.
  <br>
  I would love to listen full on every time. But as I said before sometimes (probably most of the time)
  I find myself to drawing conclusions while still in the middle of a conversation. It would be good to leave it and wait and see what might come as a natural result.
  <br>
  And I would love to sustain to use my technique throught the art - music and paintings.<p>

  Thank you for reading.
