  <h3><cite> What is the relationship between mindfulness and self-awareness. </cite></h3>

  <p>
  These two complementary concepts go hand in hand.  Mindfulness is your state of mind while doing various actions, being conscious of what you are doing.  Through these actions one can become self-aware.
   </p>

  <p>This week I tried the body scan.  I’ve tried this technique before, especially when I’ve had tension headaches or when I feel some kind of physical discomfort and I wish to ease the pain or tension.  After this I usually feel more grounded and my energy levels rise.

  <h3><cite> What do you take from the ‘My Emotions Are Not Me?</cite></h3>

  <p>It’s easy to remind yourself that you are not anger or other emotions when you are not actually experiencing them. However once you are irritated, or enjoying yourself, it’s hard to step back and look from a third person perspective.  My technique is to remind myself that our body is like a car, but our spirit is the driver.   Does the spirit need a car or does the car need a spirit?
