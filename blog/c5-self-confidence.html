<h3><cite> How confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process: </cite></h3>

<p> I had a big problem with the chessboard exercise from Eloquent Javascript book. I find myself overthinking simple solutions. I did not set up my second variable to set empty spaces. I spent 2 hours tweaking with the code. In the end I went to sleep and next morning it hit me and after 10 minutes everything was in place. I've learnt that sometimes you just have to step back to find the solution.
 </p>

<p>I usually start with a pseudocode or just try something. I also use the rubber duck method quite often, usually when I am trying to explain the problem to my poor wife, I help myself to find a solution. Google is my biggest friend when it comes to problem solving techniques. I haven't had a problem when I have to ask my peers or coaches to  help yet. That might come soonish.

<h3><cite> Explain  <code>Map()</code>, <code> filter</code> & <code>reduce()</code> </cite></h3>

<p>A<code>Map()</code>is useful if you want to apply a transformation to every item in the array and collect up the results in a new array. Sometimes the map function is not enough. Sometimes we want to apply changes only to some items. Items that match only certain tasks. For this purpose we use a  <code> filter</code> and <code>reduce()</code> is used when you want to find a cumulative or concatenated value based on elements across the array. (This method reduces the array to a single value).
