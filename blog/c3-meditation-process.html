    <h3><cite>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?<cite></h3>

    <p>It is a really familiar concept to me. I believe meditation is being able to live in the moment.  I have met people like the guy in the video before, and have been inspired by their teachings. </p>

    <h3><cite>What new things have you learnt about meditation?<cite></h3>

    <p>Nothing new, but nice to be reminded of how beautiful the mind can be, and how it can be trained so that we all can find inner peace and stay calm no matter what.</p>

    <h3><cite>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?<cite></h3>
