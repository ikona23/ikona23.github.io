<h3><cite> How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS? </cite></h3>
<p> JavaScript, Hthml and Css are complementary technologies, when HTML provides primary structure, Css provide basic styling, wheres JavaScript provides interactivity.HTML is a mark up language whith anotates  a basic website structure and JavaScript is a scripting language and it's used to add client-side interactivity to a page. </p>

<h3><cite> Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life. </cite></h3>
<p> Control flow is a fundamental concept in programming that allows you to dictate how your code runs under different conditions or until a certain condition is met. Painting house can be good example for loop explanation. 1. preparation of the surface must be finished till next step. When is finished next step can start 2. painting - painting has more loops init ( paint one wood afer another till it's finished) if not reapeat again.</p>
<h3><cite> Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals. </cite></h3>
<p>JavaScript arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. In JavaScript array is made with <code>var array-name = [item1, item2, ...]; </code> and we can access by calling individual field <code>item[num]='item'</code> or field of array <code>var item = [item1,tem2,....]</code>Objects are basic data structure. Everything in javascript is an object. Everything. Arrays, functions, even numbers! An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method. Let's create this simple Object <code>var objectName = {propertyName};</code>we can access object properties <code>objectName.propertyName</code></p>

<h3><cite> Explain what functions are and why they are useful. </cite></h3>
<p>Function is a block of code designed to perfolm a particular task. Function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses (). <code>function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {code to be executed
}</code>. Function can be called, anytime when its needed.</p>
