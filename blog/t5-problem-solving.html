<h3><cite> How confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process: </cite></h3>

<p> I've got a big problem with the chessboard exercise from Eloquent Javascpript book. I find myself overthinking simple solutions. I did not set up my second variable to set empty spaces. I spent 2 hours tweaking with the code. On the end I went to sleep and next day morning it hits me and after 10 minutes everything was on the place. I've learnt that sometimes you just have to step back to find the solution. </p>

<p>I usually starting with a pseudocode or just trying something. I am using also rubber duck method quite often, usually when I am trying to explain the problem to my poor wife, I find my self to find a sulution. Google is my biggest friend  when it comes to problem solving techniques. I haven't had a that kind of problem when I have to ask my peers or coaches to ask for a help. That might come soonish. </p>

<p><code>Map()</code> is useful if you want to apply some transformation to every item in the array and collect up results in new array. Sometimes map function is not enough. Sometimes we want to apply changes only to some items. Items that match only certain tasks. For this purpose we are using <code>filter()</code> and reduce() is used when You want to find a cumulative or concatenated value based on elements across the array.(method reduces the array to a single value) </p>
