         <p style= "text-align: center;">From watching <a href= "https://siyli.org/resources/#_videos">Search inside yourself</a>, what I've learned is that through observing the body, we are able to control our emotions. Our body is signaling warnings even before an emotional process is started. To be aware of this is a big advantage, through acknowledging these impulses one is able to control the unpredictable weather of emotions. I learned more about meditation, attention and mindfulness. </p>

        <p style= "text-align: center;">I've been trying to practice a mindfull life for some time. Sometimes I forget about "The MOMENT". My practice consists of observing my own breath, without trying to control it. I found it one of the hardest exercises in my life.</p>
