<p><cite>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</cite></p>

<p> I am learning what I need from day one. It's good to have structure and a work-like environment and that's what I was missing in my previous confused solitary dev life. I am here to give it my all - learn as much I can and share it with my fellow students. </p>

<p><cite>What are your impressions?</cite></p>

<p> I am very impressed and humbled by the people, that I've had the chance to meet in EDA. It's well thought out and organized learning structure. </p>

<p><cite>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</cite></p>

<p> I think I can "survive", grow and better myself with killer web-dev skills. I like the forum environment, and I'm happy to be working with like-minded people. I can't wait what next weeks will brings. </p>

<p><cite>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</cite></p>

<p> Not really. Google prepared me enough :) Of course I had the chance to meet some people from EDA and I think they are cool and lovely. </p>

<p><cite>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</cite></p>

<p> Yes, it does make me nervous, and I'm also excited. I already went through my first thrill. I also have a little bit anxiaty speaking and writing english. I promise, I will get better. </p>
