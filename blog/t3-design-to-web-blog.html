<h3><cite>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important.<cite></h3>

<p>In this age the internet is one of the most important forms of media. These days the internet is accessed mostly by mobile devices like cellphones, tablets and watches. Therefore website content needs to be dynamic and fluid, based on the user's device or browsing preference. Every business should look at this and change accordingly.  </p>

<h3><cite>What mobile first design is, and why it's important.<cite></h3>

<p>The mobile first concept evolved around the idea that websites should be designed for mobile users first. Mobiles have a very limited space for displaying content, therefore it is very important to prioritize information. When designing mobile first websites we have to think about fast load times, and internet speed restrictions.
  The whole concept is to give mobiles the most important content, without enhancements - just quickly delivered information.</p>

<h3><cite>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons.<cite></h3>

<p> Frameworks are tools for rapid website development. It help us to create a structure
  faster, more efficiently, and with more precision and control. Using them is more secure due to proper html semantics.
  Frameworks usually have a lots of support and are open source. Those are the pros.
  One big con is, you learn the actual framework but not necessarily the language. Work with framework can be limited.

<h3><cite>What a wireframe is and why we use it.<cite></h3>

<p> A wireframe is a visual interpretation or mock-up of an interface using only simple symbols. They avoid any colors and images
and are used to communicate the informational hierarchy structure of content or the flow of your application or website.
We use it to plan and structurize our website. It's easy to spot the issues. It's much easier to change the wireframe than the
website. It helps you to see what needs to be prioritized and how to achieve the main goal of a website. It simplifies communication between developer and client.</p>

<h3><cite>The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why.<cite></h3>

 <p> So far I haven't had any issues with wireframes.  I have had experience with other frameworks, so this concept is familiar to me. </p>
