<p><cite>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</cite></p>

<p> I am trying pomodoro technique with a combination of growing small habbits. After every hour of learnig, I spent 15 minutes of working around the house, or just a bit of drawing. If everything is going well, I am keep going. I am also meditating for some years and find it as very comforting place to be. Mindfulness and realizing that life is breathing through me, is giving me special moments in my life. </p>

<p><cite>What did you find interesting?</cite></p>

<p> Structure technique like a pomodoro is giving me more focus and mind feels sharp/ I do not feel that I have to stop.  Since I am doing little bit of exercise after every blog (push-ups), I found that my body is a bit sore :).   </p>

<p><cite>What worked for you?</cite></p>

<p> Meditation and mindfulness always worked for me.</p>

<p><cite>Which will you experiment further with?</cite></p>

<p> I want to keep working on little habbits and keep meditating.</p>
