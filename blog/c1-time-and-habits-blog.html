          <p><cite>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</cite></p>
            <p> I am trying the pomodoro technique with a combination of growing small habits. After every hour of learning, I spent 15 minutes of working around the house, or just a bit of drawing. If everything is going well, I keep going. I have been also meditating for some years and find it a very comforting place to be. Mindfulness and realizing that life is breathing through me, gives me special moments in my life. </p>
          <p><cite>What did you find interesting?</cite></p>
            <p> A technique like pomodoro gives me more focus and my mind feels sharp. I do not feel that I have to stop.  Since I am doing a little bit of exercise after every blog (push-ups), I found that my body is a bit sore :). </p>
          <p><cite>What worked for you?</cite></p>
            <p> Meditation and mindfulness always worked for me.</p>
          <p><cite>Which will you experiment further with?</cite></p>
            <p> I want to keep working on little habits and keep meditating.</p>
